# Fertility rates are dropping around the world

## Project Abstract

In South Korea, the fertility rate — the average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive years — is now 0.78, according to figures released by the Korean government in February. It could be years before the country can reach the 2.1 rate that experts say is needed for a country to maintain a stable population without migration.

South Korea is far from alone. In 2020, the United States saw 43 states register their lowest fertility rates in at least three decades. And the U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2034, people 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18 for the first time in U.S. history. In January, China also recorded its first population decline in decades.

My analysis found that South Korea has the largest percent drop in its fertility rate from 2010 to 2020 at -32%. The Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden, which have been known for their gender egalitarian policies and high fertility rates, had four of the 10 largest percent drops. Fertility rates in Latvia and Hungary, on the other hand, have risen more than 20% since 2010.
